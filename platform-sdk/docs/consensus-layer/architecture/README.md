# Architecture

The topic-organized lens on the consensus layer. Each topic file describes the topic's responsibilities, state, contracts, and links to related concepts, invariants, decisions, and scenarios.

## Top-level files

- `overview.md` — high-level shape, adapted from `Consensus-Layer.md` for KB use (pending).

## Topics

One file per topic, in `topics/`. Eleven topics total.
